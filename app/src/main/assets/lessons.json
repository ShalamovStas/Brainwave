    "Text":"The photo shows a street at night. There's a sign in the background - it looks like it says Theatre. There are a number of people in the street. The woman in the sunglasses looks like a pop singer or film star. The man in the grey suit next to the woman is a TV reporter, I think. He's holding a microphone and interviewing her. He looks very excited. They are walking away from the theatre. Perhaps she is the star of a show, but I'm not sure. The people to the right of the man are photographers-they look like paparazzi-and they're taking photos of the woman. In the top right-hand corner of the photo, I can see a TV camera too. On the left we can see just the hands of some people. One of them is holding a notebook and the woman with long blonde hair is writing something in the notebook with a blue pen. It looks as though she's signing her autograph. So I guess the people on the left are fans of the woman.",
